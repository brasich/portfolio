Now, almost 2 years on, I’ve just wrapped up my last exam; the only thing left to do is wait for my diploma to show up in the mail and watch the Longhorns win the national championship.
Looking back, this was absolutely a worthwhile experience and I’m glad to have taken on the challenge. From the outset, I was hoping this program would prove to be an antidote to imposter syndrome, as well as a sort of creative outlet to try new techniques that weren’t necessarily well-suited to the types of problems I encounter at work. With few exceptions, each course certainly helped in those areas.

Cars are silly expensive and, oftentimes, cars are slow.
Cars are Expensive Here in Denver, and for the hobbies I pursue, car ownership seems like a necessary evil. It’s the only viable way to get deep into the mountains, especially in the winter, or to the further reaches of the city and suburbs given the rampant urban sprawl. As someone who works from home and loves riding my bike, I should be the perfect candidate for ditching my car. And yet, when it came down to it, I still found it far more “logical” to spend $1,000 on a set of winter tires for my car for the ski season than spending a couple hundred to refurbish my commuter bike that’s served me tirelessly for years and years with zero recurring costs. That skewed sense of logic is car brain talking, so let’s put some actual numbers to it.

This short passage from the introduction to The Death and Life of Great American Cities by Jane Jacobs kept coming back to me as I read the rest of this incredible book. While written primarily about New York in the early-mid 1900s, so many of the lessons are still vividly applicable to the cities I have called home. Her observations contrast the organic, human-oriented aspects of vibrant and diverse neighborhoods with the tendency of so-called “urban renewal” projects to segregate the city into functional blocks, as if we were designing a factory rather than a community.

The most fun part of data science is getting to play around with new, state-of-the-art algorithms, which can continually be at odds with the realities of the workplace. In a business context, there’s a ton of work that goes into test design, data collection, feature engineering, model interpretability, etc. When it’s finally time to train a model, though, the more responsible choice is often to use a standard model from an open source library, maybe do some amount of hyperparameter tuning, get 80% of the benefits in 20% of the time compared to a deeper approach, and move on to the next problem.

At the exact same time, Reddit’s expensive new API pricing (complete with 30-day adoption timeline) and following hostile reaction to community protest among unpaid moderators, place it at the same precipice.
I won’t get into the fact that this was inevitable, or that I should have seen it coming, or that it happens to every social platform as it crashes into the need to make money, mainly because others have done a much better job expressing it:

Is it going to be worth it? Will it be manageable alongside work and other hobbies? Your guess is as good as mine.
How did I get here? The first 3 years of my career leading to my current role as a senior data scientist have been self-taught. I took a job as a business analyst in pursuit of a faster-paced work environment and the greater ownership of complete products that a more digital-focused role allowed over the mechanical engineering field I went to school for. Almost immediately, I found myself surrounded by people working on the types of projects I had previously only experienced in buzzword form - huge machine learning models making predictions using big data, supplying insights to other cloud-hosted microservices. Puttering along at a neighboring desk working on my own projects in excel wasn’t going to cut it for long.
