Valente Still, it’s been a shocking reminder that for so many people who use on the internet for community, entertainment, art, and work, reliance on a monolithic platform can be catastrophic. When one man over-pays for Twitter as a half-joke he can’t back out of, his need to see a return means I can’t talk to my friends across the country about the latest Righteous Gemstones episode without running into a paywall. When Reddit decides it’s time to ramp up for an IPO, it means I can’t use a tracker-free 3rd party app to keep up with reactions to the day’s F1 race.\nThese decisions on the parts of these business make total sense - interest rates are up, investor money is no longer free, so it’s time to flip the mytical switch to profitability. Everything costs, and a place to share Alex Albon memes isn’t an inalienable right.\nCouple all of this with how slow and painful the modern web has become to navigate: Try to search for a recipe and it’ll be buried beneath 1000 words of seo-optimized narrative, ad placements, cookie consent pop-ups - laptop fans ramping up as the browser chugs through dozens of external advertiser and analytics tracking scripts. To my eye, it doesn’t need to be this way. We don’t need cookie consent pop-ups if our sites don’t need to use tracking cookies. We don’t need tracking cookies if we don’t need as much advertising. We don’t need as much advertising if our costs are lower. We don’t face as high hosting costs if our sites our simpler.\nThe way forward, is actually backwards. I’ve been hosting this blog on GitHub Pages as a static site generated with Hugo. Back when I started, it was just because that was the easiest and cheapest way I could build something I had complete control over while still learning useful skills.

In the days before Reddit became the 1-stop shop, I would methodically hop between a couple dozen blogs and RSS feeds to get news, thoughts, musings, etc. on topics I cared about from sources I trusted. When I had an issue with my car, I could go on an entire forum dedicated specifically to owners of 1st generation Ford Escapes and get answers. It all loaded fast, ads were minimal, life was good. Those tools never went away, they just went out of style, and maybe it’s time to bring them back.\nMoving one step beyond my previous GitHub Pages deployment, this blog is self-hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4.
